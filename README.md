# Overstarch
*Overstarch* is a .Net Core library written in Visual Basic that allows access to player information and stats for [Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)) by scraping user profiles and using hidden, non-public Blizzard APIs.

This library is intended to be a replacement for the no longer maintained [Overwatch.Net](https://github.com/sirdoombox/Overwatch.Net).

## Pending Rewrite
This branch contains the code for the `3.0.0` rewrite and will be merged with `development` once I have the API in a semi-stable spot.
