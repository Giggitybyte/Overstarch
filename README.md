# Overstarch
Overstarch is a .Net Core library written in Visual Basic that allows access to player stats for [Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)) by scraping user profiles and using hidden, non-public Blizzard APIs.

This library is intended to be a replacement for the seemingly abandoned [Overwatch.Net](https://github.com/sirdoombox/Overwatch.Net).
